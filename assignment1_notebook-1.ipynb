If the function argument is in incorrect form, the function should return 0. Don't forget to test it. (**4 marks**)\n",

For demonstration purpose you want to include Australia or another country, which was able to deal with the COVID epidemics more or less successfully, and a country with large number of cases. Make a new list **country_list**, which contains iso codes of the countries. (**1 mark**)\n",
